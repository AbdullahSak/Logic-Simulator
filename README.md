# Logic-Simulator
Program to Simulate Logic Elements

This is a program where you can drag and drop and simulate some of the logic elements such as and/or gate, D flip-flop and etc.         
In this program, VDD represents logic 1 and GND represents logic 0. Furthermore, there is a clock element which toggles between logic 1 and 0 in 1 second period. You can change its period in the "Main.cpp" file.       
The simulator uses SFML library for GUI operations. The library are not added since it can be found on the web.       
For logic elements' texture, add this "assets" folder into your project or change the path in the "Classes.h" folder accordingly.       

Please feel free to give any feedback. You can use the code any way you want.
